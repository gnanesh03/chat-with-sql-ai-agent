# chat-with-sql-ai-agent

i have used mysql database and imported all the datasets data into the tables

the llm used is llama3 from meta which can be downloaded and run locally

the llm takes the database schema and the question from user and generates the sql query

the sql query is executed by the agent and the results are sent to the user using python's fastapi framework
